<h2>The first post</h2>


I am embarrassed that it took me ages to upload a posting on GitHub blog.

I was struggled so much and almost gave up. 

HOWEVER, I finally made it!

This is so exciting, I can't wait to share my journey to becoming a *professional* developer haha

Wish me luckðŸ’•



```python
def convert(seconds):
    seconds = seconds % (24 * 3600)
    hour = seconds // 3600
    seconds %= 3600
    minutes = seconds // 60
    seconds %= 60

    return "%d:%02d:%02d" % (hour, minutes, seconds)

# Driver program
n = 12345
print(convert(n))
```
