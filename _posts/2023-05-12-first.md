<h2>The first post</h2>


I am embarrassed that it took me ages to upload a posting on GitHub blog.

I was struggled so much and almost gave up. 

HOWEVER, I finally made it!

This is so exciting, I can't wait to share my journey to becoming a *professional* developer haha

Wish me luckðŸ’•





```python
if favorite_season == "Winter":
    print("That is my favorite season too")
elif favorite_season == "Summer":
    print("Summer is amazing")
elif favorite_season == "Spring":
    print("I love spring")
else:
    print("Fall is my mom's favorite season")
